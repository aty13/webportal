            <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Pinbox ("we", "our", or "us") collects,
                uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Email Address (Optional):</strong> If you choose to sign in or contact support, we may
                    collect your email address.</li>
                <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Photos you add to your pins are stored locally on your device by default.
                </li>
                <li><strong>User-Generated Content (Optional):</strong> If you use social features, we collect pins you
                    share publicly, comments, likes, and profile information (username, profile photo).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Information Automatically Collected</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We use your location data to display your position on the map and to
                    help you create pins at your current location. This data is processed locally on your device unless
                    you choose to sync it to the cloud.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous usage data to help us improve the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> For advertising purposes (free version only), we may collect
                    device advertising identifiers (IDFA).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide and maintain the App's functionality (displaying maps, saving pins).</li>
                <li>To sync your data across devices (if you opt-in to cloud sync).</li>
                <li>To display personalized advertisements (unless you purchase the ad-free version).</li>
                <li>To improve app performance and user experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>We use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> For displaying advertisements in the free version.</li>
                <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> For authentication, analytics, and optional cloud synchronization.</li>
                <li><strong>Apple Maps:</strong> For providing map functionality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Advertising and Tracking</h2>
            <p>When using the free version of Pinbox, we display advertisements through Google AdMob. This involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> AdMob may collect your device's advertising identifier (IDFA)
                    to show personalized ads.</li>
                <li><strong>Ad Tracking:</strong> Information about ads you view and interact with may be collected.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Sharing:</strong> Ad performance data may be shared with Google and advertising
                    partners.</li>
                <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can limit ad tracking in your device settings (Settings > Privacy >
                    Tracking) or remove ads entirely with a one-time $2.99 purchase.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you purchase "Remove Ads", no advertising identifiers are collected and no
                ads are shown.</p>

            <h2>5. User-Generated Content</h2>
            <p>If you choose to use social features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Posts:</strong> Pins you share publicly are visible to all app users.</li>
                <li><strong>Comments and Likes:</strong> Your interactions on public content are visible to other users.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Profile Information:</strong> Your username and profile photo (if set) are visible to other
                    users.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Moderation:</strong> We reserve the right to remove content that violates our
                    Community Guidelines.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>By default, your pins, photos, and location data are stored locally on your device. If you choose to use
                cloud features (sign in with Apple or email), your data is securely stored using Firebase services.</p>
            <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encryption in transit (HTTPS)</li>
                <li>Secure authentication (Sign in with Apple, Firebase Auth)</li>
                <li>Access controls on cloud-stored data</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Stored on your device until you delete the app or clear data.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud Data:</strong> If you use cloud sync, data is retained until you delete your account.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> All cloud data (pins, photos, comments, likes, profile) is
                    permanently deleted within 30 days of account deletion.</li>
                <li><strong>Backup:</strong> You can export your data at any time before deletion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
            <p>You have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access</strong> your data stored in the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Delete</strong> your account and associated data at any time through the app settings
                    (Account > Delete Account).</li>
                <li><strong>Export</strong> your data in JSON format.</li>
                <li><strong>Opt-out</strong> of personalized advertising through device settings or by purchasing
                    "Remove Ads".</li>
                <li><strong>Control</strong> what data is synced to the cloud (local-only mode available).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your data may be transferred to and stored on servers located outside your country of residence. By using
                Pinbox, you consent to the transfer of your data to countries that may have different data protection
                laws than your country.</p>
